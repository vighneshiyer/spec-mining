abstract = {Technical publications often make either subjective or unsubstantiated claims about today's functional verification process-such as, 70 percent of a project's overall effort is spent in verification. Yet, there are very few credible industry studies that quantitatively provide insight into the functional verification process in terms of verification technology adoption, effort, and effectiveness. To address this dearth of knowledge, a recent worldwide , double-blind, functional verification study was conducted, covering all electronic industry market segments. To our knowledge, this is the largest independent functional verification study ever conducted. This paper presents the findings from our 2014 study and provides invaluable insight into the state of the electronic industry today in terms of both design and verification trends.},

abstract = {Effective system verification requires good specifications. The lack of sufficient specifications can lead to misses of critical bugs, design re-spins, and time-to-market slips. In this paper, we present a new technique for mining temporal specifications from simulation or execution traces of a digital hardware design. Given an execution trace, we mine recurring temporal behaviors in the trace that match a set of pattern templates. Subsequently, we synthesize them into complex patterns by merging events in time and chaining the patterns using inference rules. We specifically designed our algorithm to make it highly efficient and meaningful for digital circuits. In addition, we propose a pattern-mining diagnosis framework where specifications mined from correct and erroneous traces are used to automatically localize an error. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on industrial-size examples by mining specifications from traces of over a million cycles in a few minutes and use them to successfully localize errors of different types to within module boundaries.},

@techreport{Mirzaeian,
abstract = {We propose a novel methodology for design error diagnosis in the HDL description using a word-level solver. In this approach, the patterns that result in erroneous responses are first used to limit the number of initial error candidates. The RTL description of the design is then modified by adding one multiplexer to each of the possible error locations. For each of the erroneous pattern, the input pattern and the expected correct response are then imposed as constraints to the modified RTL model, resulting in a formula suitable for word-level satisfiability (SAT) solving. The solutions reported by the word-level SAT solver would indicate the potential error candidates. This constraint solving process iterates for each erroneous pattern, eventually resulting in a small set of error candidates. This method is sufficiently flexible to address both single-error and multiple-error diagnosis. We present experimental results for a set ofpublic RTL benchmark designs to demonstrate the effectiveness ofthis proposed approach.},

abstract = {Recent advances in Boolean satisfiability have made it an attractive engine for solving many digital very-large-scale-integration design problems. Although useful in many stages of the design cycle, fault diagnosis and logic debugging have not been addressed within a satisfiability-based framework. This work proposes a novel Boolean satisfiability-based method for multiple-fault diagnosis and multiple-design-error diagnosis in combinational and sequential circuits. A number of heuristics are presented that keep the method memory and run-time efficient. An extensive suite of experiments on large circuits corrupted with different types of faults and errors confirm its robustness and practicality. They also suggest that satisfiability captures significant characteristics of the problem of diagnosis and encourage novel research in satisfiability-based diagnosis as a complementary process to design verification.},

abstract = {We present DESSERT, an FPGA-accelerated methodology for simulation-based RTL verification. The RTL design is automatically transformed and instrumented to allow deterministic simulation on the FPGA with initialization and state snapshot capture. Assert statements, which are present in RTL for error checking in software simulation, are automatically synthesized for quick hardware-based error checking. Print statements in the RTL design are also automatically transformed to generate logs from the FPGA, which are compared on the fly against a functional golden-model software simulator for more exhaustive error checking. To rapidly provide waveforms for debugging, two parallel deterministic FPGA-accelerated RTL simulations are run spaced apart in simulation time to support capture and replay of state snapshots immediately before an error. We demonstrate DESSERT, running on public-cloud FPGAs at extremely low cost, by catching bugs in a complex out-of-order processor hundreds of billions of cycles into SPEC2006int benchmarks running under Linux.},
